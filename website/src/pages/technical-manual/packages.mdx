# Strudel Packages

The [strudel repo](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel) is organized as a monorepo, containing multiple npm packages.
The purpose of the multiple packages is to

- organize the codebase into more modular, encapsulated pieces
- be able to opt out of certain functionalities
- keep the dependencies of the core packages small

## Overview
