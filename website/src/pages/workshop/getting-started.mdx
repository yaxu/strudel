# Welcome

<div className="w-32 animate-pulse md:float-right ml-8">![Strudel Icon](/icons/strudel_icon.png)</div>

Welcome to the Strudel documentation pages!
You've come to the right place if you want to learn how to make music with code.

## What is Strudel?

With Strudel, you can expressively write dynamic music pieces.<br/>
It is an official port of the [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) pattern language to JavaScript.<br/>
You don't need to know JavaScript or Tidal Cycles to make music with Strudel.
This interactive tutorial will guide you through the basics of Strudel.<br/>
The best place to actually make music with Strudel is the [Strudel REPL](https://strudel.cc/)

## What can you do with Strudel?

- live code music: make music with code in real time
- algorithmic composition: compose music using tidal's unique approach to pattern manipulation
- teaching: focussing on a low barrier of entry, Strudel is a good fit for teaching music and code at the same time.
- integrate into your existing music setup: either via MIDI or OSC, you can use Strudel as a really flexible sequencer

## Examples

Here are some examples of how strudel can sound:

These examples cannot fully encompass the variety of things you can do, so [check out the showcase](/intro/showcase/) for some videos of how people use Strudel.

## Getting Started

The best way to start learning Strudel is the workshop.
If you're ready to dive in, let's start with your [first sounds](/workshop/first-sounds)
