# MIDI and OSC

The default audio output of Strudel uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
It is also possible to use Strudel with MIDI and OSC / [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/) instead.

# MIDI API

Strudel also supports midi via [webmidi](https://npmjs.com/package/webmidi).

## midi(outputName?)

Either connect a midi device or use the IAC Driver (Mac) or Midi Through Port (Linux) for internal midi messages.
If no outputName is given, it uses the first midi output it finds.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`chord("<C^7 A7 Dm7 G7>").voicing().midi()`} />

In the console, you will see a log of the available MIDI devices as soon as you run the code, e.g. `Midi connected! Using "Midi Through Port-0".`

## midichan(number)

Selects the MIDI channel to use. If not used, `.midi` will use channel 1 by default.

## ccn && ccv

- `ccn` sets the cc number. Depends on your synths midi mapping
- `ccv` sets the cc value. normalized from 0 to 1.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`note("c a f e").ccn(74).ccv(sine.slow(4)).midi()`} />

In the above snippet, `ccn` is set to 74, which is the filter cutoff for many synths. `ccv` is controlled by a saw pattern.
Having everything in one pattern, the `ccv` pattern will be aligned to the note pattern, because the structure comes from the left by default.
But you can also control cc messages separately like this:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`$: note("c a f e").midi()
$: ccv(sine.segment(16).slow(4)).ccn(74).midi()`}
/>

# OSC/SuperDirt API

In mainline tidal, the actual sound is generated via [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/), which runs inside SuperCollider.
Strudel also supports using [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/) as a backend, although it requires some developer tooling to run.

## Prequisites

Getting [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/) to work with Strudel, you need to

1. install SuperCollider + sc3 plugins, see [Tidal Docs](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/) (Install Tidal) for more info.
2. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. download [Strudel Repo](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/) (or git clone, if you have git installed)
4. run `pnpm i` in the strudel directory
5. run `pnpm run osc` to start the osc server, which forwards OSC messages from Strudel REPL to SuperCollider

Now you're all set!

## Usage

1. Start SuperCollider, either using SuperCollider IDE or by running `sclang` in a terminal
2. Open the [Strudel REPL](https://strudel.cc/#cygiYmQgc2QiKS5vc2MoKQ%3D%3D)

...or test it here:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`s("bd sd").osc()`} />

If you now hear sound, congratulations! If not, you can get help on the [#strudel channel in the TidalCycles discord](https://discord.com/invite/HGEdXmRkzT).

Note: if you have the 'Audio Engine Target' in settings set to 'OSC', you do not need to add .osc() to the end of your pattern.

## SuperDirt Params

Please refer to [Tidal Docs](https://tidalcycles.org/) for more info.

But can we use Strudel [offline](/learn/pwa)?
