# Using CSound with Strudel

ðŸ§ª Strudel has experimental support for csound, using [@csound/browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csound/browser).

## Importing .orc files

To use existing csound instruments, you can load and use an orc file from an URL like this:

<MiniRepl
  client:only="react"
  tune={`// livecode.orc by Steven Yi
await loadOrc('github:kunstmusik/csound-live-code/master/livecode.orc')
note("c a f e").csound('FM1')
`}
/>

Note that the above url uses the `github:` shortcut, which resolves to the raw file on github, but you can use any URL you like.

The awesome [`livecode.orc by Steven Yi`](https://github.com/kunstmusik/csound-live-code) comes packed with many sounds ready for use:

<MiniRepl
  client:only="react"
  tune={`// livecode.orc by Steven Yi
await loadOrc('github:kunstmusik/csound-live-code/master/livecode.orc')
note("c a f e").csound(cat(

## Writing your own instruments

You can define your own instrument(s) with `loadCsound` like this:

<MiniRepl
  client:only="react"
tune={`await loadCsound\`
instr CoolSynth
    iduration = p3
    ifreq = p4
    igain = p5
    ioct = octcps(ifreq)

    kpwm = oscili(.05, 8)
    asig = vco2(igain, ifreq, 4, .5 + kpwm)
    asig += vco2(igain, ifreq * 2)

    idepth = 2
    acut = transegr:a(0, .005, 0, idepth, .06, -4.2, 0.001, .01, -4.2, 0) ; filter envelope
    asig = zdf_2pole(asig, cpsoct(ioct + acut + 2), 0.5)

    iattack = .01
    isustain = .5
    idecay = .1
    irelease = .1
    asig *= linsegr:a(0, iattack, 1, idecay, isustain, iduration, isustain, irelease, 0)

    out(asig, asig)

endin\`

"<0 2 [4 6](3,4,2) 3\*2>"
.off(1/4, add(2))
.off(1/2, add(6))
.scale('D minor')
.note()
.csound('CoolSynth')`}
/>

## Parameters

The `.csound` function sends the following p values:

|     |                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------- |
| p1  | instrument name e.g. `CoolSynth` |
| p2  | time offset, when it should play |
| p3  | the duration of the event / hap  |
| p4  | frequency in Hertz               |
| p5  | normalized `gain`, 0-1           |

There is an alternative `.csoundm` function with a different flavor:

|     |                                   |
| --- | --------------------------------- |
| p4  | midi key number, unrounded, 0-127 |
| p5  | midi velocity, 0-127              |

In both cases, p4 is derived from the value of `freq` or `note`.

## Limitations / Future Plans

Apart from the above listed p values, no other parameter can be patterned so far.
This also means that [audio effects](/learn/effects/) will not work.
In the future, the integration could be improved by passing all patterned control parameters to the csound instrument.
This could work by a unique [channel](https://kunstmusik.github.io/icsc2022-csound-web/tutorial2-interacting-with-csound/#step-4---writing-continuous-data-channels)
for each value. Channels could be read [like this](https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/master/Android/CsoundForAndroid/CsoundAndroidExamples/src/main/res/raw/multitouch_xy.csd).
Also, it might make sense to have a standard library of csound instruments for strudel's effects.

Now, let's dive into the [Functional JavaScript API](/functions/intro)
