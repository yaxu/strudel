These are the release notes for Strudel 0.9.0 aka "Bananenbrot"!

The last release was over 11 weeks ago, so a lot of things have happened!

Let me write up some of the highlights:

## Improved Synth Engine

The synth engine has gotten a lot of love + a name: [superdough](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superdough) encapsulates the web audio based synth / sampler / fx engine into a reusable package, which is already used by [Topos](https://topos.raphaelforment.fr/).
Main new features include:

- [filter envelopes](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/learn/effects#filter-envelope)
- [FM Synthesis](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/learn/synths#fm-synthesis)
- [looping samples](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/learn/samples#loop), allowing [wavetable synthesis](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/?I9myTNQoKKaP)
- [vibrato](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/learn/synths#vibrato)
- an integration of [ZZFX](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/learn/synths#zzfx)

## Desktop App Improvements

Thanks to @daslyfe and @vasilymilovidov , the desktop app now has its own rust based MIDI and OSC integrations,
which do not depend on browser APIs!

You can see superdough, superdirt via OSC + hardware synths via MIDI all together playing in harmony in this [awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxQgBeLQBgk). These are the related PRs:
