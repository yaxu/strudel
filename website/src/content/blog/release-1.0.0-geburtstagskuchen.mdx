These are the release notes for Strudel 1.0.0 aka "Geburtstagskuchen"

This release marks the 2 year anniversary of the project, the first commit was on the 22nd January 2022 by Alex McLean.

If you generally need a heads up on what happened to Strudel in the last year, read the [2023 recap](/blog/#year-2)

import { Youtube } from '@src/components/Youtube';

<Youtube client:only="react" id="ByPFmSBqQk0" />

A lot has happened since then, and also since the last release 16 weeks ago.

Let me write up some of the highlights:

## Breaking Change

This version changes the default cps value from 1 to 0.5 to give patterns a little bit more time by default.
If you find your existing patterns to be suddenly half the speed, just add a `setcps(1)` to the top and it should sound as it did before!

- make 0.5hz cps the default by @yaxu in https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/pull/931

## New Domain

Strudel is now available under [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/). The old domain still works but you might not get the most recent version.

- replace strudel.tidalcycles.org with strudel.cc by @felixroos in https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/pull/768

## Strudel on Mastodon

Strudel now has a mastodon presence: https://social.toplap.org/@strudel
